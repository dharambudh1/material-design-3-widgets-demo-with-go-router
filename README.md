# Material Design 3 Widgets Demo with GoRouter

## Description:
This project serves as a demonstration of the brand-new Material 3 Widgets within the Flutter framework.

  - The following widgets have transitioned to Material 3:
    - AlertDialog
    - AlertDialog with TextField
    - AppBar
    - Card
    - SimpleDialog
    - ElevatedButton
    - FloatingActionButton
    - Material
    - NavigationBar
    - NavigationRail
    - OutlinedButton
    - StretchingOverscrollIndicator, which replaces the GlowingOverscrollIndicator
    - TextButton
    - Medium Sliver AppBar
    - Large Sliver AppBar

Note: I've opted for the [GoRouter](https://pub.dev/packages/go_router) package to handle screen navigation.

Important: The Flutter team is currently working on Material Design 3 support for other components like, Icon button, Segmented button, Bottom app bar, Chips, Popup menus, Menu bars & Cascading menus, Drawer, Switch, Text fields, AppBar - medium & large variants, Time picker, Date picker, Material banner and many more.
